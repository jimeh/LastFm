# LastFm

This library provides some a Ruby interface to interact with the  Last.fm API. For the time being you can only get data from Last.fm. 

First of all I would like to thank [gordonbisnor][gordon] for his [Rails plugin][plugin] on which I started building. I started writing this library as I was not satisfied with existing Ruby clients for Last.fm. This project is far from being complete and it is not well tested but works quite well for my current project. The reason for writing this library is that most of the existing clients were not Rubyish enough and were tightly attached to Rails. In order to start using this library be sure you have a [Last.fm API][api] key and secret key.


## Installation

### Gem install

    sudo gem install last_fm

Then in your code require it as 

    require 'last_fm'


## Examples

Load your configuration

    LastFm.load_configuration(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY)

Get information for an artist

    artist = LastFm::Artist.new('Pink Floyd')

See the attributes for the artist object

    artist.methods

Get an album of this artist

    artist.album('The Wall')

Get a track of this artist

    artist.track('High Hopes')

Get an album

    LastFm::Album.new('Bonobo','Animal Magic')
    LastFm::Album.search('Bonobo','Animal Magic')
    LastFm::Artist.search('Bonobo').album('Animal Magic')

Get a track

    LastFm::Track.new('Bonobo','Silver')
    LastFm::Track.search('Bonobo','Silver')
    LastFm::Track.search('Bonobo').album('Silver')

Get user information

    LastFm::User.new('p3010010').top_albums


## Dependencies

The only requirement is ActiveSupport.


## Notes

LastFm gem was developed in a hurry and is not a full blown LastFm client neither extensively tested. Feel free to fork it :)
